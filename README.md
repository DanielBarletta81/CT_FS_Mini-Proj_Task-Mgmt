A simple HTML/ Bootstrap Task Manager Website.

The styling is intentionally basic at this point, as I'm trying to learn some of the built-in bootstrap styles.

There is a simple navbar at the top that offers the option for the site. A dropdown is included for further navigation.

The Dashboard page has forms for adding tasks, marking tasks completed, and deleting tasks.

The Register and Login pages have simple validation included that requires characters in the input, or negative feedback will be provided.

I am still working on styling my forms, getting better layout, and I put in a modal on the dashboard page to get a quick view of tasks.

Please contact me on GitHub or by email: dbarletta1981@outlook.com if you want to talk about this project!
